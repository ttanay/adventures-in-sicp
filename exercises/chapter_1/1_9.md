```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
    b
    (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(+ 4 5)
Substitution:
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
(9)

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
    b
    (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

(+ 4 5)
Substitution:
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
(9)
```

The second process is iterative because the state of the next substituion can be determined by the previous one. This is not possible for the first process. The shape of the first process also grows and then reduces.
