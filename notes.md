> When modelling phenoemna in science and engineering, we begin with simplified,
inclomplete models. As we examine things in greater detail, these simple models
become inadequate and muust be replaced by more refined models.

> Declarative and imperative descriptions are intimately related, as indeed are mathematics
and computer science. For instance, to say that the answer produced by a program is "correct"
is to make a declarative statement about the program.

-p22


> All computer programs are imperative knowledge about the theories specified by mathematical
definitions. These mathematical definitions are declarative knowledge.

**Applicative Order**: Evaluating arguments before applying

**Normal Order**: Evaluate the arguments only when you need the value


**Recursive procedure**: It is a syntactic fact that the procedure definition either directly or indirectly refers to itself.

**Recursive process**: When we describe a process as following a pattern that is linearly recusrive, we are speaking about how the process evolves, not about the syntax of how it is written.

**Tail-recursive**: A property by which the implementation executes an iterative process in constant space, even if the iterative process is described by a recusive procedure.
